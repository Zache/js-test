# the great learning

The purpose of this exercise is to learn, so there are some rules:
  - no libraries allowed unless specified in the challange
  - if you know you can use a ES6 feature to do exactly the thing you are supposed to do, maybe try and do it yourself anyway?
  
## getting started
To get started you need to
  - Clone this repo
  - Make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed and on your path (together with npm)
  - `npm install`
  - `npm test` &mdash; to run all the tests once
  - `npm start` &mdash; to have the tests run everytime you save
